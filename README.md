# SVG to PNG Converter

A simple web-based tool that converts SVG files to PNG format INCLUDING TEXT with customizable dimensions.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Click "Choose File" to select your SVG file
3. (Optional) Adjust the width and height values (default is 1000x1000)
4. Click "Convert to PNG"
5. Click the download link that appears to save your PNG file

## Requirements

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- JavaScript enabled

## Notes

- The output PNG will maintain the aspect ratio of your original SVG
- The tool works entirely in your browser - no files are uploaded to any server

## Limitations

- SVGs with external resources (images, fonts) may not convert correctly - I haven't tested it :/
